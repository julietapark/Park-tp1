    <h5>My Letterboxd top 4 and why it's important.</h5>

    <p> In recent years the movie industry has developed new and reformed ways of experiencing the ways of cinema, this article centers itself in the new (but not so new) reviewing app called <a href="https://letterboxd.com/" title="Letterboxd signing page" target="_blank">Letterboxd</a>. Many argue that its use has made cinema less enjoyable by making the amount of films one watches a competition, while many others explain that such a library of knowledge and communication withing de "film enjoyer" community means so much more than a few that may or may not view cinema as a way of competing with others.</p>

    <p> As of today i have brought five films that impacted my way of viewing films since i have started using the app:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/la-jetee/" title="La Jetée on Letterboxd" target="_self">La Jetée</a>, <em>Chris Marker</em> (1962)</li>

        <li> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/city-of-god/" title="Cidade de Deus on Letterboxd" target="_self">Cidade de Deus</a>, <em>Fernando Meirelles</em> (2002)</li>

        <li> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/the-400-blows/" title="Les Quatre Cents Coups on Letterboxd" target="_self">Les Quatre Cents Coups</a>, <em>Francois Truffaut</em> (1959)</li>
        
        <li> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/my-life-as-a-zucchini/" title="Ma vie de Courgette on Letterboxd" target="_self">Ma vie de Courgette</a>, <em>Claude Barras</em> (2016)</li>

    </ul>

    <p> Even though this four films have shaped the way many percieve cinema, there are many others that have yet to discover the unending world of films, however by promoting this types of apps we are allowing others to access to content that otherwise they would not be able to see or even know.</p>
